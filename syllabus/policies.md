## Stat 133 Course Logistics and Policies

_I reserve the right to make changes to the syllabus_

-----

As Stat 133 gets larger and larger every year, running the course as smoothly as possible becomes more challenging. Please take some time to carefully read all the course policies. They should let you know what the game rules are, the _do's_ and _dont's_, and what to expect. While writing this document, I've tried to be as comprehensive and clear as possible, leaving little room for misinterpretation. In case of doubt, contact me or any member of the GSI staff.

### Class Participation

- Lecture is meant to discuss concepts and fundamentals of computing with data.
- Attending lecture is part of your grade.
- We will track attendance with short questions asked during lecture.
- To receive full credit, you need to be present and answer at least 80% of 
asked questions throughout the semester. Otherwise, you won't receive credit 
for participation.


### Labs

- Weekly labs are a required part of the course and they are meant to supplement lecture.
- You must attend the discussion group you are officially registered in.
- Do not take the class if you cannot attend the discussion you are registered in.
- Lab assignments will be released every week, and their solutions will be posted on bCourses after submission deadlines.
- Due to the ever-present logistical issues at the beginning of every semester, we will keep a grace submission period for labs 1 and 2 till Sep-15.
- You will be encouraged to problem solve individually or in groups.
- Each person must submit each lab independently to bCourses, but you are welcome to collaborate with other students in your lab room.
- To receive credit, you must attend lab, work on the lab assignment until you're finished or the lab period is over, and get checked off by a course staff member.
- If you finish the lab early, we encourage you to help others with their lab.
- Due to the ever present logistical issues at the beginning of every semester, you will have till Sep-15 to submit the first three labs to __bCourses__.
- Your lab score will be computed based on both: 1) lab attendance, and 2) submission of completed lab assignments to bCourses.
- If a student does not attend lab but submits early:
    + Early complete submission without attending lab: 10 pts (full credit)
    + Early incomplete submission without attending lab: default deduction of 4 pts (for not attending), and then deduction of points depending on the proportion of incompleted work.
- If a student attends lab:
    + Full attendance (4 pts) and complete submission (6 pts): 10 pts (full credit)
    + Partial attendance (2 pts) and complete submission (6 pts): 8 pts
    + Full attendance (4 pts) and incomplete submission (? out 6 pts): points deducted depending on the proportion of incompleted work.
- You run the risk of losing attendance points if you have an early incomplete submission. In other words, we strongly encourage you to attend lab.


### Homework

- In this Fall 2018 edition of Stat 133 we've decided to formally split assignments into two kinds:
    1. __warm-up__ assignments
    2. __work-out__ assignments
- Homework assignments are __NOT__ eligible for regrades.
- The homework assignments will get substantially more difficult as we
progress with the course.
- __No assignments will be dropped.__ 
- Please plan ahead and pace yourself. Don't wait until the last day to do an assignment. Don't wait until the last minute to submit your assignments.
- If you collaborate with other students when working on a HW assignment, please include the names of those students in your submission.
- You must write your own answers (using your own words). Copy and plagiarism will not be tolerated (see _Academic Honesty_ policy).
- Learning programming is frustrating, but it can be fun.



### Warm-Up Assignments

- One type of assignments consists of so-called "warm-up" assignments.
- Roughly speaking, a warm-up assignment is a relatively simple piece of work.
- They should allow you to acquire the basic skills that you will later apply on the so-called 
_work-out_ assignments.
- Due to the ever present logistical issues at the beginning of every semester, you will have till Sep-18 to submit the first three warm-ups to __bCourses__.
- After Sep-18, no late warm-up assignments will be accepted.
- Warmup assignments will be graded on correctness by selecting some problems (typically the most challenging parts of the assignment).
- The applicable grading scheme for each assignment will be announced on bCourses. 



### Work-Out Assignments

- The second type of assignments are what we call "work-out" assignments.
- You will submit your work-out assignments to your private Github repository. 
- You should also submit the github's link of your assignment to bCourses.
- __Late work-out assignments__ will receive a deduction of 50%. An assignment is considered to be late if it is submitted or pushed after the corresponding deadline (up to a week later).



### Piazza

- We will use Piazza as a Q&A forum (and for some official announcements).
- To join the class on Piazza, follow this link [piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/stat133](https://piazza.com/berkeley/spring2018/stat133)
- If you have questions about anything related to the course, please post them on Piazza rather than emailing the instructor or GSIs.
- Please do not post anything resembling a solution to a homework problem before it's due. If in doubt, you should make your post private (visible to instructors only).
- See the [Piazza Etiquette](piazza.md) section for more on using Piazza. 



### Exams

- There will be one 50-minute in-class midterm, and one 3-hour final exam.
- The midterm exam will be held in class (during lecture period). Tentative date on Friday, October 5 (to be confirmed). 
- The final exam will be held from 7pm to 10pm (room TBD) on 12/10/18, as scheduled by the university, in a room to be announced.
- If you do not take the final, you will NOT pass the class.
- Unless you have accommodations as determined by the university, you must take the midterm and the final at the dates and times provided here.
- Please check your course schedule and make sure that you have no conflicts with these exams.There will be __no early or makeup exams__. 
- Do not take the class if you are not available at these dates and times.
- Please don't cheat. It's not worth it.
- If I see you doing something that looks like cheating (e.g. moving your lips, talking, looking at someone else's paper, acting suspiciously), I will take it AS cheating and give you a zero (No questions asked).
- We will use _gradescope_ to grade the tests.
- You will have one week after grades are published on gradescope to request a regrade for the midterm. The final test is NOT eligible for regrades.
- Please only ask for regrades if you see an error in the grading rather than a dispute with the rubric.
- During the regrading process you can lose points, even for questions you did not ask to be regraded.
- Regrades are based on what you actually wrote, not on what you were thinking, or what you meant to say, or what you assumed or failed to assume.
- After the regrade deadline, no requests will be considered, even if there was an error in the grading.



### Oral Evaluation

- I reserve the right to have a meeting with you and evaluate your understanding of the material in person (oral examination, whiteboard coding, and live coding).
- Testing in person can happen haphazardly (most of the time), but it can also occur based on special circumstances (e.g. grad students, strong programming background, allegedly cheating/plagiarism, unusual low or high performance).
- Oral evaluations may be comprehensive.
- The purpose of this evaluation is for me to have a more direct way of assessing your entire work (e.g. knowledge, skills, thinking process, problem solving).



### Grading Structure

Grades will be assigned using the following weighted components:

| Concept              | Weight |
|----------------------|--------|
| Class participation  |   5%   |
| Lab work             |  10%   |
| Warm-up assignments  |  20%   |
| Work-out assignments |  30%   |
| Midterm              |  10%   |
| Final                |  25%   |
| _Oral evaluation_    |   ?%   |

- No individual letter grades will be given for midterm, or final.
- You will get a letter grade for the course that is based on your overall score.
- The course will not be curved, but details of grading criteria will not be announced in advance. 
- In theory, it is certainly possible for all students to receive high grades in this course if all of you show mastery of the material on exams and complete all assignments.
- Letter grades are final; I don't enter into negotiations with students about grades.
- Please do not embarrass yourself and me by begging for extra credit or late submissions after final grades have been awarded.
- Also, please remember that I grade your performance, not your personal worth.

### Learning Cooperatively

With the obvious exception of exams, we encourage you to discuss all of the course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.



### Academic Honesty

Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not share your code or answers directly with other students. Doing so doesn't help them; it just sets them up for trouble on exams. Feel free to discuss the problems with others beforehand, but not the solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to yourself. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let us know ASAP. For more information please read the [Honor Code Guide for Syllabi](http://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/general/hc_guide_for_syllabi.pdf).

I (Gaston Sanchez) expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work together---but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments for you. __Cheating will not be tolerated__. Anyone found cheating will receive an F and will be reported to the [Center for the Student Conduct](http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct). If you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, please come see me with your questions. 

Rather than copying someone else's work, ask for help. You are not alone in this course! The course staff is here to help you succeed. If you invest the time to learn the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.



### Email Policy

- You should try to use email as a tool to set up a one-on-one meeting with me if office hours conflict with your schedule.
- Use the subject line __Stat 133 Meeting Request__.
- Your message should include at least two times when you would like to meet and a brief (one-two sentence) description of the reason for the meeting.
- __Do NOT expect me to reply right away__ (I may not reply on time).
- If you have an emergency, talk to me later during class or office hours.
- I strongly encourage you to ask questions about the syllabus, covered material, and assignments during class time or lab discussions. 
- I prefer to have conversations in person rather than via email, thus allowing us to get to know each other better and fostering a more collegial learning atmosphere.
- In case of cheating/plagiarism suspicion, I do not discuss things by email or bCourses.



### Special Accommodations

Students needing accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning disability, should speak with me during the first two weeks of the semester, either after class or during office hours and see [http://dsp.berkeley.edu](http://dsp.berkeley.edu) to learn about Berkeley’s policy. If you are a DSP student, please contact me at least three weeks prior to a midterm or final so that we can work out acceptable accommodations via the DSP Office.

If you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar and come see me as soon as possible to OH during the first two weeks of the semester. Do not take the class if you are not available to take the midterm, final, and/or attend lab discussions. I won't be able to provide accommodations for a late exam. Since this is a hands-on programming-based class, I don't allow coaching staff proctoring.



### Incomplete Grade

Under emergency/special circumstances, students may petition me to receive an Incomplete grade. By University policy, for a student to get an Incomplete requires (i) that the student was performing __passing-level work__ until the time that (ii) something happened that---through no fault of the student---prevented the student from completing the coursework. If you take the final, you completed the course, even if you took it while ill, exhausted, mourning, etc. The time to talk to me about incomplete grades is BEFORE you take the final (several weeks before), when the situation that prevents you from finishing the course presents itself. Please clearly state your reasoning in your comments to me.

It is your responsibility to develop good time management skills, good studying habits, know your limits, and learn to ask for professional help.
Life happens. Social, family, cultural, scholar, and individual circumstances can affect your performance (both positive and negatively). If you find yourself in a situation that raises concerns about passing the course, please come see me as soon as possible. 

__Above all, please do not wait till the end of the semester to share your concerns about passing the course because it will be too late by then.__



### Safe and Inclusive Environment

Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or GSI is responsible for 
the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a 
romantic or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. 
Any such relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.

Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you 
should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus 
policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to this 
policy, you may contact the _Confidential Care Advocates_ on campus for support 
related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be
made by calling (510) 642-1988.

The classroom, lab, and work place should be safe and inclusive environments 
for everyone. The _Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination_ 
(OPHD) is responsible for ensuring the University provides an environment for 
faculty, staff and students that is free from discrimination and harassment on 
the basis of categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, 
gender identity, and sexual orientation. Questions or concerns? 
Call (510) 643-7985, email ask_ophd@berkeley.edu, or go to 
[http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/](http://survivorsupport.berkeley.edu/).



### Letters of Recommendation

Unless I have known you at least one year, and we have developed a good collegial relationship, I do not provide letters of recommendation or any other kind of endorsement.



### Fine Print

The course deadlines, assignments, exam times, material, and policies are subject to change at the whim of the professor.
