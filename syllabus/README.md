## 1. The Big Picture and R Survival Skills

- :card_index: __Dates__: Aug 27-31
- :paperclip: __Topics__: First things first. At the conceptual level we'll discuss how data analysis projects usually start with a Research Question. Also, we'll describe how Data can actually be seen from a triangular perspective (i.e. my "3 Views of Data"). At the practical level, you'll begin learning basic survival skills for R, followed by an overall review of the RStudio workspace. Then we move on to discuss basic data types and their implementation in R around vectors and other data structures.

- :paperclip: __Topics__: In this week you'll keep learning more about R data structures like arrays and lists. More specifically, we'll focus on fundamental concepts like atomicity, vectorization, recycling, and subsetting. And given that we are studying vectors and its cousins, we'll briefly review the traditional _base_ graphics approach that is based on R vectors.

## 5. Transforming and Visualizing Tabular Data

- :card_index: __Dates__: Sep 24-28
- :paperclip: __Topics__: Because data tables are so ubiquitous, it's important that you learn how to manipulate them via R data frames in a more modern and syntactic way. How? By following the _data plying_ framework provided by the package `"dplyr"`. Likewise, we begin a comprehensive discussion on concepts for data visualization.
